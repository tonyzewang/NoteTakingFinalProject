# Note Taking App

Note Taking App allows users to add, edit, and delete notes in the web page. Because of the existence of the database, users’ notes will be kept after refreshing the page.

## Installation

1. Open the frontend and backend folder in Visual Code Studio.
2. Open a new terminal.
   - Navigate to the backend folder:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     ```
   - Run the backend server:
     ```bash
     node index.js
     ```
3. Open another new terminal.
   - Navigate to the frontend folder:
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     ```
   - Run the frontend server:
     ```bash
     npm run start
     ```
4. Go to the browser and visit [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to use the App.

## How to use this App

On the top big box, there will be two text input boxes. The top one is for note title, the bottom one is for note message. After finishing the two boxes, click Add Note, and this note will be stored in the database. When the single note appears in the bottom half of the page, there are two options: including edit and delete. Edit button allows the user to change the top and bottom note messages. Delete button allows the user to delete the message.
